# PlatformIO ESPIDF-Arduino Template

## Introduction
This template was intended to be used with the PlatformIO extension on VSCode.
It was made so you can use Arduino libraries without the default setup() and loop() functions.
Instead you have a classic main function in the form of app_main().

## How to use this project
It's straightforward, just clone the repo and open the folder on VSCode. 
PlatformIO should pick up the settings automatically and it will be ready to compile.
